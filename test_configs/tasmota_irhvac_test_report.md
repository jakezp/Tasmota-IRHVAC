### Results
✅ **PASSED**

The integration successfully loads from YAML configuration and all parameters are correctly applied. Service calls function as expected, allowing control of special features.

### Issues Found
- None significant

## 2. UI Configuration Testing

### Summary
Tested the config flow for UI-based configuration, including all steps and options.

### Test Cases
- Initial setup with device discovery
- IR protocol selection
- Sensor configuration
- Temperature settings configuration
- Mode and fan speed configuration
- Preset configuration
- Additional features configuration
- Options flow for updating settings

### Results
✅ **PASSED**

The UI configuration flow works correctly, guiding users through all necessary steps to configure the integration. The options flow allows for updating settings after initial setup.

### Issues Found
- Minor UI inconsistencies in the options flow when updating temperature settings

## 3. Error Handling Testing

### Summary
Tested the integration's response to various error conditions to ensure robust error handling.

### Test Cases
- Invalid configurations (missing required parameters, invalid values)
- MQTT broker issues (disconnection, authentication failures)
- Unreachable Tasmota device
- Sensor errors (unavailable sensors, invalid values)

### Results
✅ **PASSED**

The integration handles errors gracefully, providing appropriate error messages and fallback behavior.

### Issues Found
- When the MQTT broker is temporarily unavailable, reconnection attempts could be more aggressive
- Error messages for some configuration errors could be more descriptive

## 4. Edge Case Testing

### Summary
Tested the integration with extreme values and unusual configurations to ensure stability.

### Test Cases
- Minimum and maximum temperature values
- Various AC protocols (SAMSUNG_AC, LG_AC, MITSUBISHI_AC, etc.)
- Configuration with and without optional sensors
- Fractional temperature values with different precision settings

### Results
✅ **PASSED**

The integration handles edge cases correctly, maintaining stability and expected behavior.

### Issues Found
- Some AC protocols (particularly HITACHI_AC) may have inconsistent behavior with certain swing modes
- Temperature precision handling could be improved for some AC protocols
